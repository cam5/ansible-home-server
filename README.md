# Ansible Home Server

A collection of playbooks to help me move old projects to a repurposed old
macbook running ubuntu server.

I really should have sprung for the 256GB drive. ¯\\_(ツ)\_/¯

There's also Raspberry Pi running dnsmasq, which the other machines are relying on
for dns resolution, so that I don't need to crowd my local `/etc/hosts` with
these project's dev urls.
